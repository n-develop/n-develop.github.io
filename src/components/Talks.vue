            <p class="subtitle is-6">
              Even if you don't use it every day, you as a developer should be able to take
              "micro-steps"
              when developing the requested functionality. Just like most other skills, you need
              to practice this technique. "test && commit || revert" (TCR) is a great way to enforce
              micro-steps and sharpen your skills.

              In the course of this talk, we will explore the ideas behind
              "test && commit || revert",
              the new programming workflow invented by Kent Beck, Oddmund Str&oslash;mme,
              Lars Barlindhaug, and Ole Johannessen.
              After a short introduction we will dive right into an example. We will see why
              "losing code"
              can be a good thing and experience the beauty of
              "the test suite that is always green".
              But we will also loot at the limitations and problems of TCR.

              The importance of an automated test suite probably doesn't need to be emphasized
              these days. And with Blazor, even classic backend developers can develop functional
              frontends today. While most backend developers are familiar with writing unit tests
              for your business logic, writing tests for your frontend is a whole different story.
              In this talk, we will see how easy it can be to write helpful tests for your
              Blazor components.

            <p class="subtitle is-6">
              There are a lot of great tutorials out there to get started with Blazor. And they all
              help developers get into Blazor. But not every application is a simple ToDo app.
              In todays enterprise applications we rarely write all the code in a single
              ASP.NET Core project.

              In this talk, we will go beyond the popular ToDo app example. We will create a small
              app that separates the API and the UI in different projects. This lays the foundation
              for more complex applications. We will also use "Project Tye" to run the projects as
              Docker containers and simulate a microservice architecture.
              There are only a few slides
              used for the introduction. The rest of the time will be spent in the code to
              see how more complex solutions can be developed using Blazor.

              Even without WebAssembly.

              In this talk, we will dive into the the world of server-side Blazor.
              After a short walk through the default project template, we will create a custom
              component.

              Learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) is hard. There, I said it!
              But why is hard? And what can you do to make TDD less frustrating to learn/use?

              In this talk you will get to know the "missing pieces" of most TDD introductions.
              You will learn, why "red - green - refactor" isn't enough
              and how dependency injection and other techniques will help you write testable code.
