            <p class="subtitle is-6">
              Even if you don't use it every day, you as a developer should be
              able to take "micro-steps" when developing the requested
              functionality. Just like most other skills, you need to practice
              this technique. "test && commit || revert" (TCR) is a great way to
              enforce micro-steps and sharpen your skills. In the course of this
              talk, we will explore the ideas behind "test && commit || revert",
              the new programming workflow invented by Kent Beck, Oddmund
              Str&oslash;mme, Lars Barlindhaug, and Ole Johannessen. After a
              short introduction we will dive right into an example. We will see
              why "losing code" can be a good thing and experience the beauty of
              "the test suite that is always green". But we will also loot at
              the limitations and problems of TCR.

              Continous Integration and Continous Delivery are getting more and
              more popular. There are companies who will the new employees push
              changes to production on Day 1. Sounds easy, doesn't it? But if
              every commit/merge to "master" leads to an update on production,
              what do you do with your unfinished feature? Or the feature, which
              has not gotten through QA, yet?

              It does not matter if you are a Senior Software Architect with a
              lot of experience or are junior dev who just started his second
              job. The truth is you might be still responsible for bad code
              written at companies, you no longer work for. In this talk we will
              explore the basic psychology behind the "Broken Window Theory" and
              see, why it relates to software development so well.

              Learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) is hard. There, I said it!
              But why is hard? And what can you do to make TDD less frustrating
              to learn/use? In this talk you will get to know the "missing
              pieces" of most TDD introductions. You will learn, why "red -
              green - refactor" isn't enough and how dependency injection and
              other techniques will help you write testable code.
